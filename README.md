# Elderly-Companionship-App-4th-year-main-project

This project is one of the projects proposed by the Fingal Age-Friendly Programme (Older People's Council) and 
Age Friendly Ireland. The application conforms to the Centre of Excellence in Universal Design (CEUD) under the 
National Disability Authority (NDA) and Disability Act 2005. The project incorporates user-aware design and customizable 
design to reduce the difficulties of software utilization by users, therefore it can be used by as many people as possible.

The Elderly Companionship is an android application that will pertain to the Assistive Technology and Gerotechnology
context with regards to the social leisure and will allow elderly people to find friends according to various criterions. 
It will mainly provide the target audience an option to search for acquaintances and events with reference to chosen age,
hobbies/interests, name or date, and organize real meetings/outings. On top of that the application will apply appropriate 
measures (Google Map Geocoder) to find the address of current location based on the given latitude and longitude values. 

It has been also agreed to implement improved version of Android software keyboard that could be easily applicable for 
use by elderly people (enhanced layout in terms of key size, applied bright, soft and constrasting colours, or reduced
number of specific symbols).

This project has been supported with insightful research and the study group survey focused on respondents aged 60 and older. 
The intend was to evaluate the perception of the elderly towards technological trends, determine the level of their interest
in use of technology, obtain information on responders' interaction or lack of interaction with technology, or lack of awareness 
of technology (mostly smart phones and tablets).
